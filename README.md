# Hike&Guide
This is a site for guided hikes around the world.
<br><br>
This site links between tour guides and hikers.<br>
Tour guides can introduce themselves and offer their services on the site and travelers can look for a guide.
<br><br>
It also provides information about places throughout the world, as well as hiking experiences about places hikers have visited.
